What is new in Scrollutil 1.3?
------------------------------

1. The scrollarea widget of the Scrollutil_tile package now uses
   ttk::scrollbar widgets on Mac OS X, too, provided that the Tk release
   is 8.6.10 or later.

2. Improvements related to the scrollsync widget.

3. Added the "scan" scrollableframe subcommand, along with mouse event
   bindings invoking the latter.

4. Significantly improved the handling of the "-width", "-height",
   "-borderwidth", and "-highlightthickness" scrollableframe options.
   The reference manual now explicitly mentions that the "-width" and
   "-height" options set the widget's *inner* dimensions, excluding the
   border and highlight rectangle (if any).

5. The mouse wheel event handling now supports nested scrollable widget
   containers.
   
6. When computing the number of units for "(x|y)view scroll" within the
   bindings for mouse wheel events, the rounding now works the same for
   both positive and negative delta values, just like in Tk 8.6.10 and
   later.
   
7. For Tk 8.7.a3 and above on X11, the mouse wheel event handling now
   includes bindings for horizontal scrolling with the aid of the
   (virtual) mouse buttons 6 and 7, which correspond to left/right
   tilting the scroll wheel of a mouse having one or two additional
   (thumb) buttons.

8. Numerous improvements in the demo scripts and documentation.

What was new in Scrollutil 1.2?
-------------------------------

1. Added the scrollableframe widget, designed as a lightweight,
   theme-able, and full-featured replacement for BWidget ScrollableFrame
   and iwidgets::scrolledframe (thanks to Harald Oehlmann for his
   proposal).

2. Added two demo scripts for the new scrollableframe widget.

3. Significant improvements related to the scrollarea and scrollsync
   widgets (thanks to Paul Obermeier for his valuable feedback and
   testing).

4. Scrollutil no longer creates aliases in the "::tk" namespace for Tk
   commands for which that namespace already contains a command of the
   same name.

5. Numerous further improvements in the code, demo scripts, and
   documentation.

What was new in Scrollutil 1.1?
-------------------------------

1. Added the scrollsync widget, designed for scrolling several widgets
   simultaneously (thanks to Paul Obermeier for his proposal and
   testing).

2. Added two demo scripts for the new scrollsync widget.

3. The scrollarea widget now supports the "-takefocus" standard option
   (thanks to Harald Oehlmann for his proposal).

4. The scrollarea "setwidget" subcommand now returns the path name of
   the previously embedded widget.

5. The mouse wheel event handling now restricts the search for the
   registered scrollable widget container that is an ascendant of the
   widget under the pointer to the widget containers within the same
   toplevel (thanks to Harald Oehlmann for his valuable feedback).

6. Several further improvements in the code, demo scripts, and
   documentation.

What was new in Scrollutil 1.0?
-------------------------------

This is the first release.  Thanks to Michael Niehren for discussions on
mouse wheel event handling in scrollable widget containers, as well as
to Paul Obermeier and Thomas Grausgruber for testing the scrollarea
widget.
